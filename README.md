Alice 3 Princess Dragon

This project uses the block programming interface known as Alice 3 to build an animation style video where Alice in Wonderland is saved by a knight. In addition to code
and assets from the AliceAtDuke YouTube channel, additional objects and methods were created to add other characters to the program, engaging with the content of the story.
